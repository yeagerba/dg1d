# DG1D
An object-oriented, 1-D discontinuous Galerkin finite element model for hyperbolic PDEs in MATLAB. 

The DG discretization object is initialized as DG(p, Mesh, ProbDef), where p is the DG polynomial degree, Mesh is a MeshClass object, and ProbDef is a ProbDef structure. See examples in the \examples directory.
